# coral_zymo_co-extractions
A modified extraction protocol to isolate both RNA and DNA from stony corals

## DNA/RNA Co-Extraction
Note: This protocol is based on coral biopsies collected and preserved in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield. Modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol are highlighted below (Zymobiomics DNA/RNA Mini Prep Kit).

Each Sample Requires (not included in kit): 
1. 8x Nuclease-Free Tubes
2. ~ 4x P1000 4x P200/20 1x P2.5
3. 1ml 100% Ethanol

Before you begin:

i.	Take out DNA HS Qubit working solution from 4°C.

ii.	Defrost samples to be extracted, these are stable at RT in DNA/RNA Shield.

 Sample Processing/Nucleic Acid Extraction

1.	Transfer entire liquid sample into a lysis tube and secure in a high-speed bead beater fitted with a 2 ml tube holder assembly (e.g., Vortex attachment). Process at maximum speed for 40 minutes. 
![272385011-16f673b0-5a62-404e-bcb8-281b330eeea8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/950e5444-b78e-4846-90d2-1e55117ea865)

Use the 40 minutes to prepare the tubes necessary for the entire extraction.

2.	Centrifuge and transfer up to 400 μl (_Modification: use 350 μl_) of the supernatant into a nuclease-free tube (not provided). 

_Note: the remaining supernatant from the bead tube should be saved (**yields ~ 350-700 μl**), store in nuclease-free tubes and keep in -20°C or -80°C for future use._

3.	Add 2 volumes of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the supernatant (2:1) (_use 700 μl_) and mix well (vortex). 
4.	Transfer 500 μl the sample into a Spin-Away™ Filter1 (yellow) in a nuclease-free tube (not provided) and centrifuge. SAVE the flow-through for RNA extraction and repeat with the additional 500 μl for a total of 1000 μl in two separate tubes, add an equal volume of ethanol (95-100%) to flow-through (500 μl to each tube) and mix well. 
5.	Store in 4°C (or on ice) until RNA Extraction below. SAVE the column for DNA purification!

### DNA Purification

6.	Add 400 μl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
7.	Add 700 μl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through. 
8.	Add 400 μl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 2 minutes to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Carefully transfer the column into a nuclease-free tube (not provided).
9.	Add 60 μl (some is lost in the filter, some will be used for Qubit) ZymoBIOMICS™ DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix, incubate for 5 minutes, and then centrifuge to elute DNA from the respective column. 

_NOTE: I use this 5 minutes to do step 10, as there is plenty of time to pipette 12 tubes and spin down for 3 mins._

10.	Place Zymo-Spin™ III-HRC Filter in a Collection Tube and add 600 μl ZymoBIOMICS™ HRC Prep Solution. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 3 minutes.
11.	Transfer the eluted DNA and RNA (step 6) into a prepared Zymo-Spin™ III-HRC Filter in a nuclease-free tube (not provided). Then centrifuge at exactly 16,000 x g for 3 minutes.
12.	Set DNA into fridge for Qubit prior to -80°C.


### RNA Purification

13.	Transfer the mixture (700 μl) into a Zymo-Spin™ IIICG Column1 (green) in a Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through. Complete this 3x to flow through the entire 2000 μl supernatant + ethanol.

At this point, DNase I treatment (in-column) can be performed.

14.	Following RNA binding step, add 400 μl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the column, centrifuge and discard the flow-through. 

Reconstitute lyophilized DNase I with ZymoBIOMICS™ DNase/RNase-Free Water, mix by gentle inversion and store frozen aliquots (61 μl aliquots makes 12 rxns!): #E1009-A (250 U), add 275 μl water.

DNase I Reaction Mix (per sample):
| Product | Volume | 
| --- | --- | 
| DNase I (reconstituted; 1 U/ul)  | 5 μl  | 
| DNA Digestion Buffer  | 75 μl | 
| Total | 80 μl | 

Example for 12 samples:
| Product | Volume | 
| --- | --- | 
| DNase I (reconstituted; 1 U/ul)  | 61 μl  | 
| DNA Digestion Buffer  | 900 μl | 
| Total | 961 μl | 


15.	For each sample to be treated, prepare DNase I Reaction Mix in a nuclease-free tube (not provided) and mix by gentle inversion. Then add 80 μl directly into column matrix and incubate at room temperature (20-30°C) for 15 minutes. 

_NOTE: I use this 15 minutes to Qubit DNA, while it is doable to do 12 samples in 15mins, it is tight with the timing._

16.	Add 400 μl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
17.	Add 700 μl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through. 
18.	Add 400 μl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 2 minutes to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Carefully transfer the column into a nuclease-free tube (not provided).
19.	Add 60 μl (some is lost in the filter, some will be used for Qubit) ZymoBIOMICS™ DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix, incubate for 5 minutes, and then centrifuge to elute RNA from the respective column. 

_NOTE: I use this 5 minutes to do step 20, as there is plenty of time to pipette 12 tubes and spin down for 3 mins._


20.	Place Zymo-Spin™ III-HRC Filter in a Collection Tube and add 600 μl ZymoBIOMICS™ HRC Prep Solution. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 3 minutes.
21.	Transfer the eluted DNA and RNA (step 6) into a prepared Zymo-Spin™ III-HRC Filter in a nuclease-free tube (not provided). Then centrifuge at exactly 16,000 x g for 3 minutes.
22.	Transfer RNA tubes directly to ice while performing Qubit. 
23.	After Qubit, all DNA and RNA can be stored at -80°C and remaining sample in DNA/RNA Shield can be stored long-term.

# DNA/RNA Optimization Experiment to validate kit usage

## Methods
Using Pseudodiploria strigosa (a scleractinian coral), the zymo protocol was tested using various inputs of chemical and mechanical homogenization. All treatments received a 40 minute bead-beating step (as previously tested to see DNA/RNA yield using a 5, 10, 25, and 50 minute bead-beating step).

Treatments: 
1)	As per manufacturer’s protocol (modification: 40 mins bead beating)
2)	As per MF protocol + Proteinase K (20mg/ml @55C 3 Hrs)
3)	As per MF protocol + mortar/pestle
4)	As per MF protocol + Pro K + mortar/pestle

All samples were co-extracted using varied modifications to the protocol listed above.

### As per manufacturer’s protocol (mod: 40mins bead beating)
Steps: 
1.	Transfer the coral and DNA/RNA shield from the collection tube to the bead beating tube and bead beat the samples on high for 40 minutes, laying horizontal on a beating attachment. 
2.	Centrifuge tube at 15,000 x g at RT for 30 seconds. Remove supernatant from beating tube and transfer to a new collection tube. 


### As per MF protocol + Proteinase K (20mg/ml @55C 3 Hrs)
Steps: 
1.	Remove the coral and DNA from the collection tube and place onto a sterile aluminum tray (use 2 for added durability), proceed mashing coral with mortar and pestle. Take care not to puncture the aluminum tray.
2.	Transfer coral mash/slurry back into the collection tube and spike with Proteinase K [20mg/ml] (Add 20 μl of Proteinase K to 400 μl of the sample/shield mixture **adjust according to actual output**), and incubate sample/shield/pro k mixture tube at 55oC for 3 hours.
3.	Next, transfer the incubated slurry to the bead beating tube and bead beat the samples on high for 40 minutes, laying horizontal on a beating attachment. 
4.	Centrifuge tube at 15,000 x g at RT for 30 seconds. Remove supernatant from beating tube and transfer to a new collection tube. 


### As per MF protocol + mortar/pestle
Steps: 
1.	Remove the coral and DNA from the collection tube and place onto a sterile aluminum tray (use 2 for added durability), proceed mashing coral with mortar and pestle. Take care not to puncture the aluminum tray.
2.	Transfer coral mash/slurry into the bead beating tube and bead beat the samples on high for 40 minutes, laying horizontal on a beating attachment. 
3.	Centrifuge tube at 15,000 x g at RT for 30 seconds. Remove supernatant from beating tube and transfer to a new collection tube. 


### As per MF protocol + Pro K + mortar/pestle
Steps: 
1.	Remove the coral and DNA from the collection tube and place onto a sterile aluminum tray (use 2 for added durability), proceed mashing coral with mortar and pestle. Take care not to puncture the aluminum tray.
2.	Transfer coral mash/slurry back into the collection tube and spike with Proteinase K [20mg/ml] (Add 20 μl of Proteinase K to 400 μl of the sample/shield mixture **adjust according to actual output**), and incubate sample/shield/pro k mixture tube at 55oC for 3 hours.
3.	Next, transfer the incubated slurry to the bead beating tube and bead beat the samples on high for 40 minutes, laying horizontal on a beating attachment. 
4.	Centrifuge tube at 15,000 x g at RT for 30 seconds. Remove supernatant from beating tube and transfer to a new collection tube. 

Post nucleic acid extraction, the samples were analyzed using three methods of testing nucleic acid quality/quantity.

1)	Qubit 4.0 - 1x dsDNA HS & RNA HS
2)	Nanodrop - 260/230 & 260/280 for both DNA & RNA
3)	Agilent 4200 Tapestation - RNA RIN scores (through the production of micro-gels)

## Results
From the figure below, you can see clearly the addition of Pro K and additional mortar/pestle mechanical maceration yields very poor RNA quality and quantity. Therefore using the protocol listed above with a 40 minute bead beating step with no additional chemical/mechanical homogenization steps are ideal. ![256587669-2c6b03c0-ad5d-4ba7-a0d6-c1278ac988ee](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99d93096-245f-4d46-9aad-52a0033b8ceb)
